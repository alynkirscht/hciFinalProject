# Language Learning Music Finder

## Program Description
Language learning can be a time-consuming process, but music can make it enjoyable. Songs can be a helpful tool in picking up another language according to our research, but music recommended to you by teachers or the search bar on Spotify can be boring to listen to and not your style. Now, what if you were able to generate recommendations or create a playlist in the language you were learning based on your specific music tastes? 

This project is the front end of a website (using Flask), where using the Spotify API, language learners could input their Spotify account, and based on their previous listens, this  will generate a playlist of recommendations in the user’s most listened to genre and in their selected language. 

* Using user research, personas, scenarios, and user flows my team and I were able to design different design alternatives, which eventually merged into a single prototype.
* A heuristic evaluation to find usability problems in the prototype using NN Group’s 10 usability heuristics.
* Final UI prototype is this repository!
